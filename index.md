# TypeDB OSI (Open Source Initiative) 

## TypeDB OSI Vision and Mission

A structured platform for users...

* to contribute to the TypeDB development roadmap
* to contribute to TypeDB server and libraries
* to centralise all TypeDB projects as one ecosystem
* As a vehicle to organise community projects via the TypeDB Project Incubator
* As the support structure to empower a whole new generation of software developers

## TypeDB OSI Ecosystem
TypeDB OSI Ecosystem comprises all resources and technologies to be used with TypeDB. You can browse all Ecosystem technologies via [github.com/typedb-osi](https://github.com/typedb-osi), or you can head to specific projects listed here. 

TypeDB OSI Ecosystem technologies can also take advantage of early and/or pre-releases of TypeDB in order to understand implications and impact to a maintainers project. Additionally, the internal TypeDB team will be able to better understand the impact of new releases by testing with existing TypeDB Ecosystem projects.

### Ecosystem Technologies

#### Skills Academy Series 
TypeDB Academy sessions will be scheduled on a regular basis for the community. The sessions are: 
* Getting Started with TypeDB and TypeQL
* TypeQL Basics 
* Modelling Domains Expressively 
* Machine Reasoning with Rules
* Working with Data in TypeDB

### Ecosystem Roadmap 
The TypeDB Ecosystem will also address open problems and project opportunities that would enhance or support the efforts of the larger community - whether that is exploring a new language api for an emerging programming language, or getting a head start on an IDE plug-in, we will work with the community to maintain an active list of open problems and opportunities.

#### Submit a new project idea

Submissions for new project ideas can be made via _________. These ideas will be reviewed during the monthly TypeDB OSI meeting and submittors of ideas selected for development will be notified via email. There is no obligation to own/ maintain development of submitted ideas, however, ideas submitted with interested developer/maintainer, will be prioritised.

#### Submit an idea for an existing project

Submissions for feature requests, ideas for improvement, etc., for existing projects can be made directly via the projects github repo - submit an "feature request" issue with as much detail as possible, adhering to the template provided.

For further details see TypeDB Incubator: Contribution Guidelines

## TypeDB OSI Incubator

Nurture TypeDB open source projects to a state of  maturity. Providing the community with production-ready,  high-standard of quality, independent tools to aid in, and accelerate their development.

### Benefits for maintainers and project owners

* Find community members to contribute in meaningful and productive ways
* Raise the visibility of their projects across the user base
* Maintain a standard of quality through code quality governance and resources
* Ensure continuity of the maintenance and lifetime of the project

### Projects within the Incubator can take advantage of:

* Access to TypeDB OSI mentors (see TypeDB OSI Governance 8a)  
* Github organisation maintenance - by hosting your project repo within the TypeDB OSI organisation (see TypeDB OSI Incubator 3e)
* Dedicated Discord channel within Vaticle Community Server (see TypeDB OSI Incubator 3g)
* Github organisation wide standards for contribution, including but not limited to: PR and issue submission templates, qa standards and resources, 

### [Submit your project for induction](mailto:daniel@vaticle.com)

### Induction Protocol
Protocol for new project submissions into the TypeDB OSI Incubator should be simple for the maintainer, as well as ensure that all new projects adhere to a minimum quality standard shared by all projects within the TypeDB OSI. 

The protocol for submitting a new project is as follows - *subject to change, by agreement between the TypeDB OSI Leadership:*

1. New submission assigned to a TypeDB OSI Leader who then checks:
   1. Does the project meet prerequisites? (see TypeDB OSI Incubator 3d)
   2. If the project meets all prerequisites, the maintainer will be informed via email and invited into the github.com/typedb-osi organisation 
2. Maintainer should then create or move repo to github.com/typedb-osi organisation   
   1. If a repo already exists and maintainer would like to keep the repo in its existing location, based on existing user base and impact - work with the TypeDB OSI representative on best hosting options
3. Once a repo has been created, a discord channel will be created and maintainer will be given [typedb-osi-project-name] role
4. Finally, Maintainer and TypeDB OSI will work together to schedule an introduction talk with the community, to introduce the project to the wider TypeDB Community  

### Incubator Project Quality Standards: 
Quality standards for all new and existing projects within the TypeDB OSI Ecosystem are meant to ensure that community members have the highest confidence in the tools they use for their development, as well as ensure that Incubator projects have the greatest chance of success.  
#### Prerequisite for new projects
* Have an active maintainer/project owner willing to commit to ownership of project for at least the next 6 months

#### QA support for existing projects

* Source Code Analysis metrics
* Test coverage
* CI/CD
* Documentation

### Project Location
While we recommend to start projects within the TypeDB OSI github organisation, it is ultimately up to the maintainer to decide what is best for the project and users. 

#### Privileges and benefits of hosting your repository on https://github.com/typedb-osi

* The creator has full “maintainer” role within the project repo
* Visibility and maintainability
* Ease of collaboration
* Continuity and lifetime of the project
* Access to community-wide resources such as CI/CD
* Early access to TypeDB experimental features
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

## Development Roadmap

A forum to suggest and collaborate on the development roadmap of the TypeDB database. 

Does this include facilitating creation of new projects within key industries that might be identified by the TypeDB OSI Leadership and/or Advisors?

## Contributor Guidelines
A TypeDB OSI Contributor is someone who makes consistent improvements to TypeDB, TypeDB OSI Incubator or TypeDB OSI Ecosystem projects. 
### Becoming a TypeDB OSI Contributor 
All individuals who wish to contribute to TypeDB OSI projects and/or repos need to have a signed contributor agreement on file with TypeDB OSI. 
### Contributor Agreements
The TypeDB OSI  uses various agreements to accept regular contributions from individuals and corporations, and to accept larger grants of existing software technologies.

These agreements help us achieve our goal of providing reliable and long-lived software technologies through collaborative open source software development. In all cases, contributors retain full rights to use their original contributions for any other purpose outside of TypeDB OSI while providing the TypeDB OSI and its projects the right to distribute and build upon their work within TypeDB OSI
#### Contributor License Agreements
The TypeDB OSI desires that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to any TypeDB OSI projects complete, sign, and submit via email an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA).

The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the TypeDB OSI and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A signed ICLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to any TypeDB OSI project.

For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on an TypeDB OSI project, a Corporate CLA (CCLA) is available for contributing intellectual property via the corporation, that may have been assigned as part of an employment agreement.

Note that a Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every developer to sign their own ICLA as an individual, which covers both contributions which are owned and those that are not owned by the corporation signing the CCLA.

The CCLA legally binds the corporation, so it must be signed by a person with authority to enter into legal contracts on behalf of the corporation.

The ICLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so it is recommended to use one's personal email address in the contact details, rather than an @work address.

Your full name will be published unless you provide an alternative public name. For example if your full name is Alfred North Whitehead, but you wish to be known as Al Whitehead, please enter the latter as your Public name. Your Full name should be written with your given name first and your family name last, though your preferred ordering can be used in the Public name.

The email address and other contact details are not published.

If you are submitting an ICLA in response to an invitation from a TypeDB OSI Committee member, be sure to identify the project via the form field "notify project". Also, choose a preferred id that is not already in use. Apache ids must start with an alphabetic character and contain at least two additional alphanumeric characters (no special characters).

## Employment Forum
The TypeDB OSI Employement Forum exists to provide a forum to share full-time, part-time, and consulting work, related to TypeDB OSI Ecosystem and partner technologies, as well as Incubator projects. 
We want to create an environment that fosters experience, and career growth, across members skill levels. 
Not just development and engineering opportunities but gigs in data science, strategy, implementation and more.
