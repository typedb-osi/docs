# TypeDB OSI (Open Source Initiative) 

## TypeDB OSI Vision and Mission

A structured platform for users...

* to contribute to the TypeDB development roadmap
* to contribute to TypeDB server and libraries
* to centralise all TypeDB projects as one ecosystem
* As a vehicle to organise community projects via the TypeDB Project Incubator
* As the support structure to empower a whole new generation of software developers

## TypeDB OSI Ecosystem and Incubator
>TypeDB OSI Ecosystem comprises all resources and technologies to be used with TypeDB. You can browse all Ecosystem technologies via [github.com/typedb-osi](https://github.com/typedb-osi), or you can head to specific projects listed here.

>TypeDB OSI Incubator aims to nurture TypeDB open source projects to a state of  maturity. Providing the community with production-ready,  high-standard of quality, independent tools to aid in, and accelerate their development.

### Submit a new project idea to the TypeDB Incubator

Submissions for new project ideas can be made via _________. These ideas will be reviewed during the monthly TypeDB OSI meeting and selected based on the TypeDB OSI roadmap. There is no obligation to own/ maintain development of submitted ideas, however, ideas submitted with interested developer/maintainer, will be prioritised.
#### [Submit a project idea](mailto:daniel@vaticle.com)

### Submit an idea for an existing project

Submissions for feature requests, ideas for improvement, etc., for existing projects can be made directly via the projects github repo - submit a "feature request" issue with as much detail as possible, adhering to the template provided.

For further details see [TypeDB Incubator: Contribution Guidelines](#Contributor Guidelines)

## Call for Contributors
>A TypeDB OSI Contributor is someone who makes consistent improvements to TypeDB, TypeDB OSI Incubator or TypeDB OSI Ecosystem projects. All individuals who wish to contribute to TypeDB OSI projects and/or repos need to have a signed contributor agreement on file with TypeDB OSI.

### Employement Forum
Hosted on the [Discussion Forum](#discussion-forumhttpsforumvaticlecom), the TypeDB OSI Employement Forum exists to provide a forum to share full-time, part-time, and consulting work, related to TypeDB OSI Ecosystem and partner technologies, as well as Incubator projects.

### Contributor Agreements
The TypeDB OSI  uses various agreements to accept regular contributions from individuals and corporations, and to accept larger grants of existing software technologies.

These agreements help us achieve our goal of providing reliable and long-lived software technologies through collaborative open source software development. In all cases, contributors retain full rights to use their original contributions for any other purpose outside of TypeDB OSI while providing the TypeDB OSI and its projects the right to distribute and build upon their work within TypeDB OSI.
